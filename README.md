Do you have too many sensors with the same I<sup>2</sup>C address? Connect them to the SparkX PCA9846 Qwiic Mux to get them all talking on the same bus! This Qwiic Mux enables communication with multiple I<sup>2</sup>C devices that have the same address. This Qwiic Mux also has eight configurable addresses of its own, allowing for up to 32 I<sup>2</sup>C buses on a single connection. To make it even easier to use this multiplexer, all communication is enacted exclusively via I<sup>2</sup>C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system.

The PCA9846 Qwiic Mux is very similar to our classic [8-channel Qwiic Mux](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16784), except:

* It has four ports on a super-cute 1" x 1" PCB
* The PCA9846 has a "Who Am I" (Device ID) product identification register which makes it _much_ easier to detect in auto-detect DataLogger / OpenLog applications.
